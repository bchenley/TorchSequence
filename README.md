## Installation

To use TorchTimeSeries, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `python -m venv TorchTimeSeries-env`
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `.\TorchTimeSeries-env\Scripts\activate`
   - Linux/Mac: `source TorchTimeSeries-env/bin/activate`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install torch`

## Getting Started

TorchTimeSeries facilitates time series analysis with the following steps:

### Preparing Time Series Data

Before using TorchTimeSeries, you need to prepare your time series data. Ensure that your data is properly formatted and includes features and labels if applicable. 

### Dataset and Dataloader

Utilize the provided Dataset and Dataloader classes to load and preprocess your time series data. These classes handle batching, time series windowing, and other common data loading operations, streamlining the process of feeding data to your model.

### Model Development

Develop your time series model using the TorchTimeSeries framework. You can customize the model architecture, incorporate different layers, and leverage PyTorch's extensive library of modules. Refer to the documentation for guidance on building and customizing your model.

## Training and Evaluation

Train and evaluate your TorchTimeSeries model using the provided training and evaluation procedures. Configure the loss function, optimization algorithm, and performance metrics according to your specific time series analysis task. Use the built-in training loop to iteratively optimize your model and evaluate its performance.

## PyTorch Lightning Integration

TorchTimeSeries integrates with PyTorch Lightning, providing an easy-to-use interface for training and running experiments. Leverage the power of PyTorch Lightning's capabilities, such as distributed training and automatic optimization, to enhance your time series analysis workflow.

## Result Visualization

Visualize the results of your time series analysis using TorchTimeSeries's result visualization tools. Generate plots, charts, or other visual representations to gain insights into the model's performance, interpretability, or predictions.

## Saving Results

Save the results of your time series analysis for future reference or sharing. TorchTimeSeries provides mechanisms to save trained models, evaluation metrics, and other important artifacts. Utilize the saving functionalities to persist and load your analysis results.
