2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `.\torchsequence-env\Scripts\activate`
   - Linux/Mac: `source torchsequence-env/bin/activate`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install torch torchaudio torchvision`

## Getting Started

TorchSequence simplifies time series analysis with the following steps:

### Preparing Time Series Data

Before using TorchSequence, you need to prepare your time series data. Ensure that your data is properly formatted and includes features and labels if applicable. 

### Dataset and Dataloader

Utilize the provided Dataset and Dataloader classes to load and preprocess your time series data. These classes handle batching, shuffling, and other common data loading operations, making it easy to feed your data to the model.

### Model Development

Develop your time series model using the TorchSequence framework. You can customize the model architecture, incorporate different layers, and leverage PyTorch's extensive library of modules. Refer to the documentation for guidance on building and customizing your model.

## Training and Evaluation

Train and evaluate your TorchSequence model using the provided training and evaluation procedures. Configure the loss function, optimization algorithm, and performance metrics according to your specific time series analysis task. Use the built-in training loop to iteratively optimize your model and evaluate its performance.

## PyTorch Lightning Integration

TorchSequence seamlessly integrates with PyTorch Lightning, providing an easy-to-use interface for training and running experiments. Leverage the power of PyTorch Lightning's capabilities, such as distributed training and automatic optimization, to enhance your time series analysis workflow.

## Result Visualization

Visualize the results of your time series analysis using TorchSequence's result visualization tools. Generate plots, charts, or other visual representations to gain insights into the model's performance, interpretability, or predictions.

## Saving Results

Save the results of your time series analysis for future reference or sharing. TorchSequence provides mechanisms to save trained models, evaluation metrics, and other important artifacts. Utilize the saving functionalities to persist and load your analysis results.
